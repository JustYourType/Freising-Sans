# Summary of the modifications from Inter to Freising Sans:
The Idea was to give a similar look to all styles, that should appear more friendly with bigger dots and open appertures
- spacing & kerning latin optimized & restructured 
- redesign and resize all dots and similar, especially in the Black Master
- redesign all commas and comma accents
- redesign all appertures to open opertures in latin-glyph-set, as C, S, G, e, g, 3 or similar shapes
- redesign Numbers for more open and friendly appearance
- redesign german ß + Capital
- more expressive tail for l and t 
– switch l & l.ss02
- reworked some alignment issues
- reduction of salt feature
- export with more spacing
- Renaming: SemiBold wird Bold, Bold wird ExtraBold
— Style linking: Regular + SemiBold
- Italic optimized, needs even more time (before it was only slanted)

# For greek, cyrillic
